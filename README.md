Day 4:
Today's Progress:
Today, I explored randomization in Python, including generating random integers, floating-point numbers, and simulating a coin toss. I also worked on Python lists, nested lists, and completed a fun Rock-Paper-Scissors game as my final project for the day.

What I Learned:

Random Module:
Generated random integers using randint().
Created random floating-point numbers with random() and uniform().
Used random choices to simulate coin tosses and select random elements from a list.
Python Lists:
Created lists and learned list manipulation techniques like append() and extend().
Used indexing to access specific elements in a list.
Created a nested list and accessed elements from multiple levels.
Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:
Created a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game using user input and random opponent input.
Implemented the game logic to determine the winner or draw based on user and opponent hand choices.
Challenges:
The main challenge was setting up the game logic for Rock-Paper-Scissors, ensuring that all win/lose/draw conditions were correctly handled, especially with edge cases like Rock vs. Scissors.

Thoughts:
This was a great exercise in randomness, list manipulation, and combining everything I’ve learned so far into a working mini-game. I’m excited to explore more interactive projects!
